# Analysis Page Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The CV Builder application had issues when clicking on the Analysis page, particularly in Safari. The root causes were:

1. **Port Conflicts**: The server was configured to search for alternate ports when the default one (3005) was busy, leading to mismatches between frontend and backend expectations.

2. **Unreliable API URL Resolution**: The frontend tried to dynamically find the backend by checking multiple ports (3005-3009), which could cause race conditions.

3. **Import Path Issues**: The code tried to import from both `Analyze.jsx` and `Analyse.jsx`, causing import failures.

4. **Error Handling**: Missing error boundary when loading the Analysis page components.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Port Configuration

Created consistent environment files:
- **Server (.env)**: Set `DISABLE_PORT_FALLBACK=true` to prevent the server from using alternative ports
- **Frontend (.env.local)**: Set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3005` as the fixed API endpoint

### 2. Improved Analyse Component

- Replaced dynamic port checking with a fixed API URL from environment variables
- Simplified API URL resolution to prevent race conditions and Safari compatibility issues

### 3. Enhanced Analyze Component

- Added proper error boundary for more robust error handling
- Added loading indicator during component initialization
- Improved the component to better handle errors that might occur during analysis

### 4. Created Reliable Startup Script

Developed `start-app.sh` script that:
- Terminates all existing Node.js processes to free memory and ports
- Explicitly frees ports 3005-3007 and 5173-5177 to prevent conflicts
- Starts the backend with proper environment variables
- Waits for backend initialization before starting the frontend
- Provides clear status information during startup

## How to Use

1. **Start the application**: Run `./start-app.sh` to launch both frontend and backend servers with the optimized configuration.

2. **For Safari users**: Add `?devMode=true` to the URL when accessing the application in Safari, e.g., `http://localhost:5173?devMode=true`

3. **If issues persist**: Manually kill all Node processes with `pkill -f node` and restart the application.
