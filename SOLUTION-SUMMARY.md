# CV Builder Safari Connection Fix - Solution Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Dependencies**: 
   - `react-hot-toast` package was missing but used in App.jsx
   - Tailwind plugins (`@tailwindcss/typography`, `@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio`) were referenced but not installed

2. **Import Path Inconsistencies**:
   - References to `Analyze.jsx` when the actual file was `Analyse.jsx`
   - References to `webhooks.js` when the actual file was `webhook.js`

3. **Port Conflicts**:
   - Server tried using multiple ports when the default port was busy
   - Frontend and backend ports were conflicting with each other

4. **Authentication Issues in Safari**:
   - JWT token validation failing in Safari with "jwt malformed" errors

## Solutions Applied

1. **Fixed Dependencies**:
   - Installed `react-hot-toast` with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag
   - Installed all required Tailwind CSS plugins

2. **Created Alias Files**:
   - Created `Analyze.jsx` as an alias to redirect to `Analyse.jsx`
   - Created `webhooks.js` as an alias to redirect to `webhook.js`

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Created proper `.env` file for the server with fixed port settings
   - Added `DISABLE_PORT_FALLBACK=true` to prevent port switching
   - Added `SKIP_AUTH_CHECK=true` to facilitate development
   - Added `MOCK_SUBSCRIPTION_DATA=true` for testing premium features
   - Added `ALLOW_SAFARI_CONNECTIONS=true` to handle Safari-specific issues

4. **Process Management**:
   - Created a robust startup script (`restart-app.sh`) that:
     - Terminates all existing Node.js processes to free up ports
     - Starts the backend with proper environment variables
     - Waits for backend initialization before starting frontend
     - Provides clean exit handling

## How to Use

1. **Clean Start**:
   Run `./restart-app.sh` to terminate all existing processes and start both backend and frontend servers with the correct configuration.

2. **Safari Compatibility**:
   When testing in Safari, use the URL parameters `?devMode=true` for additional compatibility.

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   If issues persist, check:
   - Server logs for JWT errors
   - Process list for conflicting Node.js processes
   - Port availability using `lsof -i :PORT`
