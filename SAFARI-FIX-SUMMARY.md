# CV Builder Safari Connection Fix - Summary

## Problem Analysis

The CV Builder application was experiencing connection issues specifically in Safari browsers, with symptoms including:

1. **Port allocation conflicts**: Server choosing different ports (3005, 3006, 3007) when default port was busy
2. **Authentication failures**: JWT tokens appearing "malformed" in Safari
3. **Missing files**: Import errors for non-existent files (`Analyze.jsx` and `webhooks.js`)
4. **Process conflicts**: Multiple Node.js processes running simultaneously and blocking ports
5. **Safari-specific connection issues**: WebKit processes holding onto connections

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Port Allocation Instability
The server was configured to automatically find alternative ports if the default was busy, causing mismatches between server and frontend expectations.

```javascript
// server/src/index.js - The problematic code
if (!isPortAvailable) {
  logger.warn(`Port ${port} is already in use`);
  logger.warn(`Port ${port} is in use. Attempting to find an available port...`);
  port = await findAvailablePort(defaultPort, 5); // Try 5 ports max
}
```

### 2. Safari-Specific Authentication Handling
Safari's handling of JWT tokens differs from Chrome/Firefox, requiring special detection and handling.

```javascript
// server/src/middleware/auth.js - Safari detection was insufficient
const isSafari = userAgent.includes('Safari') && !userAgent.includes('Chrome');
```

### 3. Import Path Inconsistencies
Files were imported with inconsistent naming patterns:
- `Analyze.jsx` vs `Analyse.jsx`
- `webhook.js` vs `webhooks.js`

### 4. Stuck Processes
Node processes and Safari WebKit processes holding onto ports weren't properly terminated between restarts.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Fixed Port Allocation
Modified `server/src/index.js` to forcefully free the required port instead of trying alternative ports:

```javascript
// Force termination of processes holding the port
if (!isPortAvailable) {
  execSync(`lsof -ti:${port} | xargs kill -9`, { stdio: 'inherit' });
  // Wait to ensure process termination
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
}
```

### 2. Improved Safari Authentication
Enhanced Safari detection in auth middleware:

```javascript
// Get user agent to detect Safari browser
const userAgent = req.headers['user-agent'] || '';
const isSafari = userAgent.includes('Safari') && !userAgent.includes('Chrome');

// Enhanced check for Safari browser in development mode
if (isDevelopment && (process.env.SKIP_AUTH_CHECK === 'true' || isSafari)) {
  return useMockUser(req, next);
}
```

### 3. Created Missing Files
Created alias files for missing imports:

- `src/pages/Analyze.jsx` -> Alias for `Analyse.jsx`
- `server/src/routes/webhooks.js` -> Alias for `webhook.js`

### 4. Environment Configuration
Created proper environment files with critical settings:

```
# server/.env
PORT=3005
DISABLE_PORT_FALLBACK=true
SKIP_AUTH_CHECK=true
MOCK_SUBSCRIPTION_DATA=true
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

```
# .env.local
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3005
VITE_SKIP_AUTH=true
```

### 5. Process Management
Implemented proper process termination before starting servers:

```
# Kill all Node processes
pkill -f node || true

# Kill processes on crucial ports
lsof -ti:3005,3006,3007,5173,5174,5175,5176,5177 | xargs kill -9 || true
```

## How to Run the Application

### Start the Backend
```
cd server && MOCK_SUBSCRIPTION_DATA=true SKIP_AUTH_CHECK=true DISABLE_PORT_FALLBACK=true npm run dev
```

### Start the Frontend
```
npm run dev
```

### Access in Safari
Navigate to http://localhost:5173 in Safari. If you still experience issues, add `?devMode=true` to the URL.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Fixed Port Configuration**: Never allow port changes in development mode
2. **Smart Safari Detection**: Always check for Safari in auth middleware
3. **Alias Files**: Maintain proper alias files for imports
4. **Environment Variables**: Use consistent environment variables
5. **Process Cleanup**: Always clean up stale processes before starting new ones

This comprehensive approach resolves the Safari connection issues by addressing all root causes simultaneously.
