# Safari Connection Fix for CV Builder

This is a comprehensive fix for Safari connection issues in the CV Builder app. It addresses all the root causes of the Safari connection problems.

## What the Fix Does

1. **Kills all conflicting processes** to ensure clean port usage
2. **Forces fixed port configuration** with `DISABLE_PORT_FALLBACK=true`
3. **Creates proper environment files** for both server and client
4. **Adds missing files** that caused import errors
5. **Configures auth middleware** to handle Safari-specific JWT issues
6. **Starts application with proper configuration** in separate terminals

## How to Use

Simply run:

```bash
npm run fix
```

Or directly:

```bash
node fix-safari.js
```

This will:
1. Kill all existing node processes
2. Configure the server and client environments properly  
3. Create any missing files
4. Start the server and client with the correct settings

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. Close all Terminal windows and Safari browser windows
2. Run: `killall node` in Terminal
3. Run: `killall "com.apple.WebKit.Networking"` in Terminal  
4. Try running the fix script again: `npm run fix`

## What Was Fixed

1. **Port conflicts:** The server was using auto-port selection, leading to mismatched ports between server and client.
2. **JWT authentication failures:** Safari had issues with JWT validation, causing "jwt malformed" errors.
3. **Missing files:** Import errors for non-existent files like Analyze.jsx and webhooks.js.
4. **Process conflicts:** Multiple server instances running simultaneously and blocking ports.
5. **Environment configuration:** Proper environment variables now set for development.
