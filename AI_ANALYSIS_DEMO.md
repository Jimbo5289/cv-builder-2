# AI Analysis Demo: Before vs After

## Issue Confirmed: Mock Results Problem

You were absolutely right! The CV Builder was generating **fake/mock results** that were the same across different industries. Here's the proof and the fix:

## üö® BEFORE: Mock/Fake Analysis

**Same CV analyzed for Technology vs Healthcare:**

### Technology Industry - Software Developer
```json
{
  "score": 82,
  "formatScore": 78,
  "contentScore": 85,
  "strengths": [
    "Good representation of developer skills",
    "Matches technology industry expectations",
    "Appropriate CV length"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Include more technology-specific terminology",
    "Highlight achievements relevant to developer positions"
  ]
}
```

### Healthcare Industry - Nurse
```json
{
  "score": 82,  // ‚ùå SAME SCORE!
  "formatScore": 78,  // ‚ùå SAME SCORE!
  "contentScore": 85,  // ‚ùå SAME SCORE!
  "strengths": [
    "Good representation of nurse skills",  // ‚ùå Just template text!
    "Matches healthcare industry expectations",  // ‚ùå Generic!
    "Appropriate CV length"  // ‚ùå No real analysis!
  ]
}
```

**‚ùå Problem:** Same scores, same structure, just different words plugged into templates!
